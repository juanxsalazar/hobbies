        <h5> Anything that sparks my creativity and mind!!! Nonfiction, Mangas, Comics, PS4, Netflix, Youtube, etc.</h5>
        <p>As a kid, I would always imagine that anything is possible in this world. I still do!!! I love thinking about life and figuring out all of the mysteries in life. My imagination adventures comes from the different stories and creativity that human kind has created.</p>
        <p>I wouldn't call myself an avid reader, but at times I do like reading. Mainly manga and comic books, but at times if I see a good nonfiction book that will teach me more about life, someone's elses life, or just history in general then I'll usually read it.  </p>
        <p>I use to play a lot of video games when I was little and watched tv all the time. Now that I'm older, I don't play as much or really watch tv. I mainly just watch netflix and youtube from time to time, and once in a while I'll play some old video games I have. </p>

    <h2>Adventure!!!</h2>
    <h5>Life is an adventure! We live to experience life. Each of us have our own adventures, and this right here is my adventure hobbies. </h5>
    <p>I like to find new things to do whether it's in st pete or somewhere else. Each day is a new day with new adventures. Some of these adventures are just my habits and hobbies, while others are actual journeys that happens rarely. We will explore three of my favorite hobby adventures plus a bonus adventure that is becoming a hobby adventure ;)</p>
    <h4>Adventure with Friends</h4>
    <h5>Eating, drinking, or simply just spending time somewhere with friends</h5>
    <p> I love people and I love my friends. My best adventures are always with friends and the new friends that I make in life.
    </p>
    <h4>Solo Adventures</h4>
    <h5> Rockclimbing, Running, or longboarding and exploring the city of St Petersburg! </h5>
    <p> I always like to invite my friends to the different things I do and at times they can't join me which is totally understandable. I learned to enjoy my own company and be able to set out on different adventures by myself and be comfortable enough to enjoy my own presence. </p>
    <p>Most of my solo adventures are also just me exercising, longboarding around st pete and just doing different activities by myself.</p>
    <h4>Imagination Adventures</h4>
    <h5> Anything that sparks my creativity and mind!!! Nonfiction, Mangas, Comics, PS4, Netflix, Youtube, etc.</h5>
    <p>As a kid, I would always imagine that anything is possible in this world. I still do!!! I love thinking about life and figuring out all of the mysteries in life. My imagination adventures comes from the different stories and creativity that human kind has created.</p>
    <p>I wouldn't call myself an avid reader, but at times I do like reading. Mainly manga and comic books, but at times if I see a good nonfiction book that will teach me more about life, someone's elses life, or just history in general then I'll usually read it.  </p>
    <p>I use to play a lot of video games when I was little and watched tv all the time. Now that I'm older, I don't play as much or really watch tv. I mainly just watch netflix and youtube from time to time, and once in a while I'll play some old video games I have. </p>
    <h4>Coding Adventure</h4>
    <h5>Bonus Adventure Time!!! </h5> 
    
    <p>Now that I'm starting this coding bootcamp, coding is going to become a new hobby that I will be exploring a lot. I have only traveled a few steps into this adventure and so far I'm loving it. Who knows what kind of experiences will come out of this new adventure, all I know is that I'm going to do my best and enjoy this journey!   </p>
  <p>Stay tuned... At the end of the Coding adventure, Juan's new adventure will start!!!</p>

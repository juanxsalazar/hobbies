        <h5> Rockclimbing, Running, or longboarding and exploring the city of St Petersburg! </h5>
        <p> I always like to invite my friends to the different things I do and at times they can't join me which is totally understandable. I learned to enjoy my own company and be able to set out on different adventures by myself and be comfortable enough to enjoy my own presence. </p>
        <p>Most of my solo adventures are also just me exercising, longboarding around st pete and just doing different activities by myself.</p>

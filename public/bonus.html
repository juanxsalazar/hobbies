    <p>Now that I'm starting this coding bootcamp, coding is going to become a new hobby that I will be exploring a lot. I have only traveled a few steps into this adventure and so far I'm loving it. Who knows what kind of experiences will come out of this new adventure, all I know is that I'm going to do my best and enjoy this journey!   </p>
  <p>Stay tuned... At the end of the Coding adventure, Juan's new adventure will start!!!</p>
